ClassyTee
=========

Classy Tee bring Class Table Inheritance to ActiveRecord and Rails in as simple a way possible.

Example
=======

if you have an existing model
  class Content < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

and you want to extend it.
Maybe you want to add a subclass that encapsulates all the logic of an MP3

  class MP3Content < ActiveRecord::Base
    classy_tee!
  end

this will look for a MP3ContentExtensions class,
and add all of its columns as though they were on the :content table.

Generate this automatically

  ruby script/generate classy_tee MP3Content mp3_url:string mp3_length:integer
